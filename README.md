  <i>Pitch presentation of the project</i>
</div>

With PaintCode, young computer science students can learn the art of programming and GUI design synergistically. This application allows for the easy creation of graphics that can be implemented in the source code of a Shell program. Without the need for libraries, students can experiment with UI and UX in their early educational steps.

PaintCode features digital design tools for WIMP interfaces, like those found in the popular software Paint, allowing developers to create graphics that can be exported as compressed code to be inserted into any other source code, or exported as a .ptc file to be edited later. PaintCode is the perfect tool for students looking to gain an understanding of both programming and GUI design in a seamless and intuitive manner.
